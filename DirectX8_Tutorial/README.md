This is the code that I used as the basis for my article \"DirectX 8 Graphics
and Video\: A Fresh Start\" which was published in November 2000 on
[gamedev.net](http://www.gamedev.net/page/resources/_/reference/programming/directx/directx-graphics/directx-8-graphics-and-video-a-fresh-start-r1247)

The article and code was the first public tutorial for DirectX 8, being
released just hours after the DirectX 8 SDK became available. At the time,
very little sample code was included with the SDK.

This code is compiled with Visual C++ 6 and the DirectX 8 SDK. Given that the
version 8 SDK is no longer available, it isn't possible to compile this code,
so I have not taken the time to modernize the code. Keep in mind that I
wrote this over a decade ago, and it doesn't match my current skill level.

* Sample 1: Initializes and shuts down DirectX, and runs a basic render loop.
* Sample 2: Draws triangles with a vertex buffer.
* Sample 3: Draws triangles with an index buffer.
* Sample 4: Adds a texture to the drawn triangles.
* Sample 5: Spins a cube of textured triangles.
* Sample 6: Uses DirectShow to play a video.
