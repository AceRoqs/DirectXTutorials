This is the code that I used as the basis for my article \"DirectX 9 Graphics\:
Improving On A Good Thing\" which I published in 2003. The article is included
in the _article_ folder.

This code was compiled with Visual C# 2003, however it depends on assemblies
that Microsoft no longer publishes or includes in Windows. In particular,
`Direct3D.GraphicsStream` was required for some of these tutorials.

* Sample 1: Initializes and shuts down DirectX, and runs a basic render loop.
* Sample 2: Draws triangles with a vertex buffer.
* Sample 3: Draws triangles with an index buffer.
* Sample 4: Adds a texture to the drawn triangles.
* Sample 5: Spins a cube of textured triangles.
* Sample 6: Uses assembly shaders instead of a fixed function pipeline.
* Sample 7: Uses HLSL shaders instead of a fixed function pipeline.
