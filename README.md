This is the code that I used as a basis for my articles "DirectX 8 Graphics
and Video\: A Fresh Start" which was published in November 2000 on
[gamedev.net](http://www.gamedev.net/page/resources/_/reference/programming/directx/directx-graphics/directx-8-graphics-and-video-a-fresh-start-r1247),
and "DirectX 9 Graphics\: Improving On A Good Thing" which I published in 2003.

The code demonstrates basic C++ and C# usage of DirectX 8 and 9, though
it's of waning utility now that Microsoft includes good sample code in the
SDK, which wasn't the case in the early 2000's.

Most of the code is compiled with Visual Studio and SDK versions that are
no longer available, so I left the code as it was written. The C++ DirectX
9 code I have ported to Visual C++ 2013 just to keep it up to date, but it
doesn't really reflect my current practices. Perhaps it might be useful to
someone.
